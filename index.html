        <p>I am Carlos Martinez, 75 years old, based in Buenos Aires, although I often travel as a film director and have my office in Los Angeles.<br>
In my youth I also traveled frequently to compete internationally in artistic gymnastics, as a national champion.</p>

        <p>After some years, I graduated as an instructor from the National Institute of Sports and taught acrobatics to actors and actresses. Immersed in that environment, I also trained as an actor. In parallel, over the past decades, I have deepened my study of sciences applied to sports and quality of life.</p>

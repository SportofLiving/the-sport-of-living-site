      <p>By using The Sport of Living you agree to these terms. We provide personalized lifestyle guidance, including exercise, nutrition, monthly updates, and (for VIP) weekly consultations and educational content.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Medical notice:</strong> We do not provide medical care. Always consult your doctor before making important changes to your diet or exercise. If you experience warning signs such as chest discomfort, unusual breathlessness, dizziness, or sharp pain, stop and contact your physician.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Your responsibilities:</strong> Provide accurate information; consult medical professionals as needed; use the service responsibly.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Payments and subscriptions:</strong> Payments are processed via PayPal. For subscription plans, your subscription renews monthly until you cancel. You can cancel at any time either by (a) managing the subscription in your PayPal account, or (b) emailing us at sportofliving@gmail.com and we will assist you. If you prefer, we can also discuss alternatives such as switching to a lower-tier plan or pausing the service for up to 3 months (when applicable).</p>
      
      <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> If you regret paying for one of our plans, you can request a refund within 30 days of the payment date by emailing sportofliving@gmail.com. If approved, we will issue the refund back to the original payment method via PayPal. We may ask for basic information to locate your payment (e.g., PayPal email and transaction ID). For subscription plans, you can also cancel future renewals at any time.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Liability:</strong> We are not liable for indirect or consequential damages arising from use of the service. Use of our guidance is at your discretion.</p>
